<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Kean health tracker's focus is to prevent students from panicing. After submitting their vaccination records, students were concerned their records were not being approved or are still pending. This caused them to believe they had limitations placed on their account. This website was an alternative method to disolve that issue. 

An example csv file that can be used to update the mongodb server - "student_csv_example.csv"
